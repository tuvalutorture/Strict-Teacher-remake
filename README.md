# Strict Teacher

YOOO wsp y'all

so this is a basic assembly game, right? made by [YoYo-Head](https://github.com/YoYo-Head/) originally, remade for cont.d by Hack Club :P

the idea here is i took the original game, which featured basic addition right <br>
and i added increasing difficulty (harder & harder math, from ez addition to nightmare multiplication)<br>
plus i made the strict teacher just genuinely be mean asf I can't lie XD

compilation steps are same as below BUT i personally run: <br>
```del main.exe && del main.obj && nasm -f win64 -g -F cv8 main.asm -o main.obj && gcc -g -m64 main.obj -o main.exe && main.exe```

runs on windows (64-bit x86 only, sorry ARM nerds XD), not lunix or macintosh

# Old README

Hey there!

This is pretty basic assembly file (x86-64).

## Program Running Instructions

To run this program, you will need to run main.exe

To compile the program, you would need to firstly have nasm and gcc tools installed for x86-64.
After that, you would need to run the following in terminal, with the directory set to the project folder:

1. nasm -f win64 -g -F cv8 main.asm -o main.obj
2. gcc -g -m64 main.obj -o main.exe

To run the file in terminal, you can simply run this: .\main.exe

## Purpose of the Program

This program is very simplistic. It essentially asks you addition questions, and depending on whether you get it right or wrong, the teacher will say a custom message. 
This program is for kids who want to get better at mental addition math. So far, it is able to take the input of the user and see whether it is right or wrong. It's
also recently been able to score results as questions now loop 5 times.
